SUMMARY

For this assignment I am going to write a Sudoku solver in Unicon that uses
recursion, generators, or both to find its solution(s).

The input to the program will be a file file name, given on the command line,
and the program will read its first command line argument, open it, and read in
9 lines, each of which contains 9 values specified by one character each,
seperated by 8 spaces. The values will be ASCII digits 1-9 or an underscore '_'
to indicate an empty position.

Your solution should be written to standard output in the same format as the
input data file, with the underscores replaced by digits.


COMPILING

Just run the `make` command.


RUNNING

Now run it!
